    short_description: A heavy iron pickaxe lies here.
    long_description: >
      This pickaxe was made for breaking rock, but it works equally well on

    short_description: A badly rusted shortsword lies discarded here.
    long_description: >
      This shortsword was left behind when the mine was abandoned. Years of

    long_description: >
      The kobolds who infest the upper mines make these spears from whatever
      they can scavenge - a sharpened piece of scrap metal lashed to a stick.

    keywords: [dagger, shadow, dark, blade, black]
    short_description: A dagger of pure darkness lies here, drinking the light.
    long_description: >
      This dagger seems to be made of solidified shadow. Light bends around

      Undercroft, where darkness has physical form.

    short_description: A heavy iron breastplate lies here.
    long_description: >

    long_description: >
      The phosphorescent moss that grows in the mine's depths has healing

    keywords: [ore, iron, rock, metal]
    short_description: A heavy chunk of iron ore lies here.
    long_description: >
      A rough chunk of iron ore, still mixed with stone. It would need to
      be smelted before the metal could be used. The smiths of Ravenmoor
      buy such ore for their forges.

    long_description: >
      This sample of ore contains visible threads of silver running through
      the stone. The deep veins of Ironvein contain precious metals as well
      as iron, though they're harder to find.

    keywords: [ore, unstable, glowing, dangerous]
    short_description: A chunk of ore pulses with unstable energy.
    long_description: >
      This strange ore radiates heat and pulses with a sickly glow. The
      miners called it "doom rock" and refused to work veins where it
      appeared. It's valuable to certain alchemists, but dangerous to carry.

    keywords: [trinket, kobold, shiny, junk]
    short_description: A worthless kobold trinket lies here.
    long_description: >
      Kobolds are attracted to shiny objects. This appears to be a bent
      spoon tied to a piece of string with broken glass beads. Worthless,
      but the kobold probably thought it was treasure.

    long_description: >

    long_description: >
      A fragment of the Guardian's outer shell. The metal is unlike
      anything forged by modern smiths - impossibly light yet stronger
      than steel, with faint runes still visible on the surface.
