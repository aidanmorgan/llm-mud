    long_description: >
      The Bloated One was once a giant toad, but death and the swamp's
      corruption have transformed it into something far worse. Its
      body is grotesquely swollen, filled with poisonous gases and
      half-digested prey. Its skin is mottled with decay, and its
      cavernous mouth can swallow a person whole. Despite being undead,
      it hungers eternally.
