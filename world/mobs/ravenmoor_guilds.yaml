      battles. Despite his age, he moves with the deadly grace of a master warrior,
      and his voice carries the authority of one who has commanded armies.

      An elven woman of indeterminate age, Archmage Vaelith's silver hair floats
      as if caught in an unseen breeze. Her robes shift colors subtly as she moves,
      and her eyes glow faintly with accumulated magical power. She speaks rarely,

      orbit her like moons around a planet.

      the calm certainty of unwavering faith.

    long_description: >
      You didn't see her arrive, and you likely won't see her leave. Shadowmaster
      Vexa moves like smoke given form, her face half-hidden by a dark hood. What
      little you can see reveals sharp features and eyes that miss nothing. Daggers
      glint at her belt, more than should be possible to carry. When she smiles,
      it's the smile of a predator.

      A weathered man whose skin is tanned like leather from years under the sun.

      Leaves and twigs seem to cling to his clothing of their own accord.
