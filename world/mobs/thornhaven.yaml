      The Briar King has shaped this guardian from the fortress's

    long_description: >
      This massive plant has a flower that can swallow a person whole.

    long_description: >
      This pitcher plant has grown to monstrous size, its digestive

    long_description: >
      This mobile plant has developed legs and multiple heads, each

    long_description: >
      This was once a guard of Thornhaven, but plant life has invaded

      Fungal infection has claimed this soldier, their body now serving

      The Thornwatch are the Briar King's elite guards, once humans

    name: The Briar King
    keywords: [briar, king, boss, knight, plant]
    short_description: A massive figure of man and plant sits upon a living throne.
    long_description: >
      The Briar King was once Sir Aldric Thornhaven, lord of this
      fortress. When a druidic curse transformed the land, he embraced
      it rather than flee, merging with the plant life until he became
      something new. Now more tree than man, he rules his domain of
      thorns from a throne of living wood, his mind as alien as his
      form. Flowers bloom in his presence, but their beauty is deadly.
