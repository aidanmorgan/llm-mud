    long_description: >
      This creature escaped its cell long ago and now roams the upper
      levels. Its original form is impossible to determine - it is a

    short_description: A being of terrible power strains against divine chains.
    long_description: >
      The First Prisoner is why the Undercroft was built - a demon lord
      of such power that it could not be destroyed, only contained.
      Chained with bindings of divine origin, it has waited millennia
      for release. Its form is that of a massive, winged humanoid,
      wreathed in shadow and flame, with eyes that have seen the
      birth and death of worlds. The chains are weakening, and it
      knows freedom is coming.
