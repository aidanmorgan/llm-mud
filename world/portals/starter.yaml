    description: >
      An ancient stone archway pulses with otherworldly energy.
      Through the shimmering barrier, you catch glimpses of dark
      corridors and flickering torchlight.
    theme_id: ancient_dungeon
    theme_description: >
      A crumbling underground complex from a forgotten civilization.
      Stone walls covered in moss and strange runes. Passages filled
      with traps, treasure, and creatures that have made the darkness
      their home. The architecture suggests a once-great empire that
      fell to some unknown catastrophe.

    keywords: [portal, dream, mist, silver]
    description: >
      Silver mist coalesces into an ethereal doorway. Through it,
      impossible landscapes shift and change - cities of cloud,
      forests of crystal, oceans of starlight.
    theme_id: dreamscape
    theme_description: >
      A surreal realm where physics and logic are suggestions.
      Landscapes that shift based on emotion and thought. Creatures
      born from nightmares and fantasies alike. Colors that have no
      names and sounds that can be seen.
