  description: >
    Ancient tunnels connect the Crucible to the volcanic Obsidian Depths below.
    Once a dwarven trade route, these passages have been abandoned for
    centuries. The heat increases steadily as you descend, and the walls
    show signs of ancient industry giving way to raw volcanic activity.
