  description: >
    An underground passage of giant mushrooms connects the toxic Mirehollow
    Swamp to the Verdant Maze. The fungi here have grown to massive size,
    forming a subterranean forest. Some glow, some release spores, and some
    are inhabited by strange creatures. The path is treacherous but beautiful.
