name: The Singing Canyon

theme:
  theme_id: echo_canyon
  description: >
    A vast canyon system connects the volcanic Ashveil Wastes to the
    Crucible's forge-city. The canyon's unique rock formations create
    natural resonance chambers that make the wind "sing." The dwarves
    once used this path for trade, and their carved passages still exist
    alongside natural formations.
