theme:
  theme_id: untamed_wilderness
  description: >
    Between Willowdale and the Shimmerwood lies an expanse of true wilderness.
    No paths exist here - the forest is dense, the undergrowth thick, and the
    way is treacherous. As you travel deeper, reality becomes stranger, and
    fey influences begin to appear.
