    short_description: Where green land gives way to scorched earth
    long_description: >
      The transition here is stark and sudden. Grass and shrubs give way to
      cracked, blackite earth, still warm to the touch. Ash drifts on hot
      winds, and the air shimmers with heat. To the west, the Ashveil Wastes
      stretch to the horizon, a blasted hellscape of obsidian spires and
      smoking vents.

    name: Ash Plains
    short_description: An endless expanse of gray ash
    long_description: >
      Fine gray ash covers everything, piling into drifts against obsidian
      outcroppings. Your footsteps leave deep prints that slowly fill back
      in. Occasionally, the wind parts the ash to reveal the cracked, glassy
      ground beneath - the remnants of a great fire that scorched the earth
      to glass.

    name: Obsidian Field
    short_description: A forest of black glass spires
    long_description: >
      Jagged pillars of obsidian thrust upward from the ash, some reaching
      twenty feet or more. They catch the ruddy light and gleam like black
      mirrors. The spaces between form a maze, and the glass edges are sharp
      enough to cut through leather. Bones lie scattered at the base of some
      spires.

    name: Cinder Canyon
    short_description: A deep ravine of smoldering stone
    long_description: >
      A great rift splits the earth here, its walls still glowing with
      residual heat from the cataclysm. Rivulets of molten rock trickle
      down the sides, and the bottom is lost in darkness and smoke. A
      precarious path winds along the canyon rim, barely wide enough for
      single-file travel.

    name: Ashborn Camp
    short_description: A cluster of heat-resistant tents
    long_description: >
      The Ashborn have made their home in the shelter of an obsidian
      overhang. Their tents are woven from fire-resistant fibers, and their
      skin is scarred and darkened from constant exposure to heat and ash.
      A central fire pit burns with strange blue flames, and the nomads
      watch newcomers with wary eyes.

    vnum: 805
    name: Smoking Vent
    short_description: Sulfurous fumes rise from the earth
    long_description: >
      A massive crack in the ground releases constant jets of sulfurous
      steam and noxious fumes. The heat is intense, and the air is barely
      breathable. Despite the danger, valuable minerals crystallize around
      the vent's edges, drawing treasure hunters to risk the poison.

    name: Lava Flow
    short_description: Rivers of molten rock flow slowly past
    long_description: >
      The ground here is divided by channels of slowly moving lava, bright
      orange and unbearably hot. Stepping stones of cooled basalt provide
      a precarious path across, but one misstep would mean death. The
      hellish light illuminates everything in shades of red and orange.

    short_description: Ancient ruins half-buried in ash
    long_description: >
      Broken walls and scattered stonework mark the remains of a structure
      that predates the cataclysm. The Ashborn consider this place sacred,
      believing it was a temple to the fire gods. Faded carvings on the
      surviving stones depict rituals of flame and sacrifice.

    name: Crater's Edge
    short_description: The rim of a vast volcanic crater
    long_description: >
      You stand at the edge of an enormous crater, the epicenter of the
      ancient eruption. The bowl stretches for miles, its depths still
      active with bubbling lava lakes and jets of flame. A path winds
      down into the crater, for those brave or foolish enough to descend.

    name: Crater Descent
    short_description: A treacherous path into the heart of fire
    long_description: >
      The path switchbacks down the inner wall of the crater, carved into
      the rock by unknown hands. The heat is oppressive, growing worse
      with every step downward. Below, the glow of molten rock creates
      an infernal illumination, and the air tastes of brimstone.

    name: Temple of the Slag Mother
    short_description: An ancient temple of living fire
    long_description: >
      This temple was built around a permanent vent of molten rock, its
      walls blackened and half-melted by centuries of exposure. A massive
      statue of a female figure composed of cooling lava dominates the
      central chamber - the Slag Mother, an elemental being worshipped
      by fire cultists. The heat here is almost unbearable.
