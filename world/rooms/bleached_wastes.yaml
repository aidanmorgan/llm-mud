    short_description: The fertile land ends abruptly at a wall of white.
    long_description: >
      Here the green grass simply stops, giving way to bleached white salt
      flats that stretch endlessly to the horizon. Bones are visible even
      from here, scattered across the pale expanse. A feeling of profound
      sadness emanates from the wasteland ahead.

      The ground is carpeted with bones - human, horse, and things less
      identifiable. Ancient weapons and armor fragments lie scattered among
      the remains. The battle that occurred here must have been catastrophic.

    short_description: The bones here are piled waist-high.
    long_description: >
      The density of remains increases dramatically here. Bones are piled
      so thick that walking requires climbing. Rusted weapons still clutched
      in skeletal hands hint at the ferocity of the ancient battle.

      This depression was once a mass grave, though the bones have long
      since risen to the surface. The spiritual energy here is oppressive,
      and ghostly wails can be heard just at the edge of perception.

      This monument was erected to honor the fallen, but time and neglect

      Thousands of weapons from the ancient battle lie here - swords, spears,
      axes, and things stranger. Most are rusted beyond use, but some retain
      an edge that defies time. Spirits are said to guard their weapons still.

      This raised area shows signs of a desperate last stand. Bones form
      a ring of defenders around a central figure in ornate armor, still
      clutching a standard. At night, this scene replays in ghostly form.

      Here, the veil between worlds is thinnest. Every night, ghost armies
      rise to fight the battle again, charging through each other in an

      visible, repeating their final moments.

      Both armies' generals were entombed here after the battle, their
      hatred so great that even death could not separate them. The tomb
      is sealed with powerful wards, but something stirs within. The
      General's Ghost awaits those foolish enough to break the seals.
