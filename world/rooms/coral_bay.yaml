    short_description: Shallow waters over the reef

      The water here is waist-deep over the extensive coral reef. The
      formations create a maze of passages between towering coral heads.
      Fish of every color imaginable swim through the clear water. It's
      beautiful, but navigating can be treacherous.

      A weathered stone lighthouse stands on a rocky promontory, its

      day and night.
