    short_description: Where darkness gives way to crystalline light
    long_description: >
      The passage from the Fungal Depths opens into a wonderland of light.
      Crystals of all sizes protrude from the walls, floor, and ceiling,
      each emitting a soft glow in various colors. The effect is
      mesmerizing, like standing inside a geode. A faint humming fills
      the air - the crystals resonating with unseen energies.

    name: Resonance Hall
    short_description: A vast chamber that amplifies every sound
    long_description: >
      This enormous cavern is lined with perfectly formed crystals that
      amplify and reflect sound. Even a whisper echoes endlessly, and
      striking a crystal produces a tone that reverberates for minutes.
      The Crystal Singers use this chamber for their rituals, their
      voices creating cascades of harmonics.

    name: Memory Chamber
    short_description: Crystals that hold echoes of the past
    long_description: >
      The crystals here are different - darker, with swirling patterns
      visible in their depths. These are memory stones, crystals that
      absorb and preserve experiences. Touch one and you might see
      visions of ancient events, hear long-dead voices, or feel emotions
      from ages past. Not all memories are pleasant.

    short_description: Formations grow like frozen flowers
    long_description: >
      Crystal formations here take shapes reminiscent of plants - delicate
      flower-like clusters, towering tree-like pillars, spiraling vine
      patterns. The effect is a frozen garden of light and color. The
      Crystal Singers tend these formations, encouraging their growth
      through resonance.

    name: Echo Maze
    short_description: Sound and light create endless confusion
    long_description: >
      The crystal formations here create a disorienting maze where sound
      and light bounce in unpredictable patterns. Your own voice returns
      from unexpected directions, and reflections make it seem like there
      are paths where solid crystal stands. Many have become lost here,
      wandering until exhaustion claims them.

    short_description: Where the Singers harvest their treasures
    long_description: >
      Careful extraction has exposed a vein of particularly pure crystals.
      The Crystal Singers use specialized tools and techniques to harvest
      without disturbing the resonance of surrounding formations. Rough-cut
      crystals are stacked for transport, glowing softly in the ambient light.

    short_description: The home of the Crystal Singers
    long_description: >
      This chamber has been carefully shaped to serve as living quarters
      for the Crystal Singers - mystics who have devoted their lives to
      understanding the crystals' resonance. Carved niches hold bedding
      and personal effects, and a central crystal has been tuned to
      provide warmth. The Singers welcome peaceful visitors.

    name: Geode Chamber
    short_description: A hollow sphere of crystal beauty
    long_description: >
      You stand inside an enormous geode - a hollow sphere completely
      lined with crystals that point inward. The effect is breathtaking,
      like being at the center of a frozen firework. Light from the
      crystals creates patterns that seem almost alive, and the resonance
      here is particularly powerful.

    short_description: The richest crystal deposits lie here
    long_description: >
      This vein of crystal runs deep into the earth, the formations here
      older and more powerful than those above. The crystals pulse with
      internal light in a slow rhythm, almost like a heartbeat. The
      miners avoid this place - something about it unsettles them.

    name: The Resonance Core
    short_description: The heart of the crystal network
    long_description: >
      At the center of the Crystaldeep network stands the Resonance - a
      massive crystal formation that seems almost aware. It pulses with
      light and emits a constant harmonic tone that resonates with every
      other crystal in the caverns. The Crystal Singers believe it is
      a living entity, the soul of the caves themselves.

      - You sense vast intelligence studying you through crystal facets.
