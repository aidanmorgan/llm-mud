    name: Sunken Causeway
    short_description: A partially flooded stone path
    long_description: >
      The causeway from Coral Bay descends into the waves, ancient stones
      slick with algae and crusted with barnacles. At low tide, you can
      walk most of it. At high tide, you must swim. Ahead, the dark
      outline of the Drowned Sanctum looms beneath the water, its towers
      reaching toward a surface they will never break.

    name: Outer Court
    short_description: A submerged plaza with pockets of air
    long_description: >
      This plaza was once open to the sky, but now water fills most of
      the space. Trapped air bubbles cling to the ceiling, providing
      breathing space for air-breathers. Coral has grown over the
      statues that once decorated the court, giving them strange,
      organic shapes.

    name: Tide Pools
    short_description: Shallow pools teeming with life
    long_description: >
      These shallow pools are home to countless sea creatures - colorful
      fish, scuttling crabs, swaying anemones. The Deep Ones harvest
      food here, and their children play in the warm shallows. Despite
      the temple's dark purpose, life flourishes in this place.

    short_description: Living spaces of the drowned clergy
    long_description: >
      These chambers once housed the temple's priests, and now the
      Deep Ones have made them their own. Strange decorations - bones,
      shells, glowing orbs - adorn the walls. The air pockets here are
      maintained by magic, creating a bubble of breathable atmosphere.

    name: Temple Hall
    short_description: The main hall of the sunken temple
    long_description: >
      Massive columns rise from floor to ceiling, carved with images of
      sea creatures and waves. The water here is darker, colder, pressing
      in with the weight of the deep. Bioluminescent algae provides the
      only light, painting everything in shades of blue and green.

    name: Coral Garden
    short_description: A cultivated garden of living coral
    long_description: >
      The Deep Ones tend this garden of coral, cultivating formations
      of stunning beauty and strangeness. Some corals glow, others
      move like animals, and a few seem almost intelligent. It's
      beautiful but alien, a reminder that this place belongs to
      creatures of the deep.

    name: Ritual Pool
    short_description: Where the Deep Ones perform their rites
    long_description: >
      This circular chamber contains a deep pool that descends into
      darkness. Around its edge, symbols are carved that glow with
      cold light. The Deep Ones gather here to commune with their
      god, chanting in a language that predates human speech. The
      water of the pool is ice cold and seems to pull at you.

    short_description: The holy of holies, deep beneath the waves
    long_description: >
      The pressure here is immense, the water dark and cold. This
      chamber was built to honor the sea god, and something of that
      ancient presence remains. A massive statue dominates the space,
      a figure half-kraken, half-something else entirely. Before it
      stands the altar where sacrifices are made.

    name: The Abyss
    short_description: Where the Abyssal Herald dwells
    long_description: >
      A shaft descends into absolute darkness, the pressure here
      crushing. This is where the Abyssal Herald dwells - a creature
      touched by the kraken gods, part priest and part monster. The
      water here is so dark and cold that light itself seems to die.
      Only the Herald's bioluminescence breaks the darkness.
