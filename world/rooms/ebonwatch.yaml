    name: Twilight Road
    short_description: A road where daylight never reaches
    long_description: >
      Even at midday, this road lies in perpetual twilight. Shadows gather
      unnaturally, pooling in corners and seeming to move when not watched
      directly. Ahead, the spires of Ebonwatch Citadel pierce a sky that
      is always dark, always starless. Something watches from the shadows.

    name: Outer Gate
    short_description: Massive gates of black iron
    long_description: >
      Gates of black iron rise thirty feet high, decorated with images
      of writhing shadows and bound spirits. The metal seems to absorb
      light rather than reflect it. Guards in dark armor stand motionless,
      and it's unclear whether they're alive, dead, or something else
      entirely.

    name: Court of Shadows
    short_description: Where the dark nobility holds audience
    long_description: >
      This vast courtyard is always in shadow, lit only by pale ghost-lights
      that provide no warmth. Members of the Shadow Court drift about,
      noble figures whose features shift and blur like smoke. They speak
      in whispers that somehow carry across the entire space.

    vnum: 1203
    name: Hall of Mirrors
    short_description: Reflections show other worlds
    long_description: >
      Ornate mirrors line both walls of this long hall, but they don't
      reflect this world. Each shows a different reality - some similar,
      some nightmarishly different. Figures move in the reflections that
      have no counterpart in the hall, and occasionally, something tries
      to step through.

    name: Spirit Cells
    short_description: Prisons for bound souls
    long_description: >
      These cells hold no physical prisoners. Instead, spirits are bound
      here by arcane symbols carved into the walls. Their ghostly forms
      press against invisible barriers, wailing silently. Some were bound
      as punishment, others as a source of power for the citadel's dark
      magic.

    name: Reflection Room
    short_description: A room that exists in multiple realities
    long_description: >
      This circular chamber seems to exist in several places at once.
      Shadows of different rooms overlay each other, and walking in one
      direction might take you somewhere unexpected. The Shadow Court
      uses this room to travel to other planes - or to trap the unwary.

    name: Binding Chamber
    short_description: Where souls are claimed for the Shadow Court
    long_description: >
      A ritual chamber where new spirits are bound to serve the citadel.
      Arcane symbols cover every surface, and chains of solidified shadow
      hang from the ceiling. The air crackles with dark energy, and the
      screams of past victims seem to echo from the walls themselves.

    name: Inner Citadel
    short_description: The heart of darkness
    long_description: >
      The inner citadel is a fortress within a fortress, its walls made
      of solidified shadow rather than stone. Here the most powerful
      members of the Shadow Court reside, plotting eternal schemes in
      eternal darkness. The very air is thick with dark magic.

    name: Warden's Vault
    short_description: Where the Umbral Warden guards forbidden treasures
    long_description: >
      This vault contains artifacts too dangerous to destroy but too
      powerful to use. Weapons that drink souls, armor that binds the
      wearer to shadow, books of forbidden knowledge - all guarded by
      the Umbral Warden, a demon bound in shadow who has served the
      citadel since its founding.

      - The Umbral Warden's presence fills the room with cold dread.
      - Shadows coil like living things around the vault's treasures.
      - You sense countless eyes watching from the darkness.
