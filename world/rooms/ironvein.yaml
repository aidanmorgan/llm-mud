    short_description: The yawning mouth of the old mine
    long_description: >
      A dark tunnel opens into the hillside, supported by rotting wooden
      beams. Rusted mining equipment lies scattered about - overturned
      carts, broken picks, and coils of frayed rope. A cold draft blows
      from within, carrying the smell of damp stone and something else...
      something unpleasant. Faded warning signs are posted near the entrance.

    name: Upper Tunnels
    short_description: A dusty mining tunnel
    long_description: >
      The tunnel here is wide enough for two to walk abreast. Pick marks
      score the walls where miners once worked the stone. Abandoned
      lanterns hang from hooks, long since out of oil. Cart tracks run
      along the floor, disappearing into the darkness ahead.

    short_description: Where several tunnels meet
    long_description: >
      Multiple tunnels branch off from this central point. Signs once
      marked which led where, but they've long since fallen or been
      destroyed. A rusty minecart sits abandoned on the tracks, its
      contents long since looted.

    short_description: An abandoned mining shaft
    long_description: >
      This shaft shows signs of collapse - rocks and debris litter the
      floor, and cracks spider across the ceiling. Despite the danger,
      veins of ore are visible in the walls. Whatever drove the miners
      away left in a hurry.

    short_description: A dark shaft to the west
    long_description: >
      Thick cobwebs hang from the ceiling here, evidence of large spiders
      making their home in these abandoned tunnels. Old mining equipment
      lies wrapped in silk, and bones can be seen among the webs. Something
      moves in the darkness.

    name: Collapsed Tunnel
    short_description: A partially collapsed passage
    long_description: >
      The tunnel here has partially given way, boulders blocking most
      of the passage. A small gap remains, just large enough for someone
      to squeeze through. Glittering objects can be seen among the
      rubble - treasures left behind when the mine was abandoned.

    short_description: The deep levels of the mine
    long_description: >
      The air here is thick and stale. The tunnel descends steeply into
      darkness, the walls slick with moisture. Strange growths cling to
      the stone - phosphorescent fungi that cast an eerie glow. The
      sounds of dripping water echo from somewhere below.

    name: Underground Lake
    short_description: A vast underground lake
    long_description: >
      The tunnel opens into a massive cavern dominated by a dark,
      still lake. Phosphorescent fungi line the shores, casting pale
      light across the water's surface. Strange ripples disturb the
      water occasionally, hinting at things that live in the depths.
      An island rises from the center of the lake.

    name: Lakeshore
    short_description: The rocky shore of the underground lake
    long_description: >
      The shore here is littered with smooth stones and the remains of
      old mining operations. A small rowboat is tied to a post, its
      wood warped but still serviceable. It could take someone to the
      island, for those brave enough to try.

    name: Kobold King's Throne
    short_description: A makeshift throne room
    long_description: >
      This cavern has been transformed into a crude throne room. A
      large chair carved from stone sits atop a raised platform,
      surrounded by piles of stolen goods. Torches burn in sconces,
      providing flickering light. This is clearly the lair of whoever
      leads the creatures that took over the mine.
