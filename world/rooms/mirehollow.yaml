    short_description: Where solid ground gives way to swamp
    long_description: >
      The ground becomes soft and uncertain here, solid earth giving way
      to dark, stagnant pools and tufts of sickly vegetation. A perpetual
      fog hangs low over the water, and the air is thick with the smell
      of decay. Strange lights flicker in the distance - will-o-wisps or
      something worse.

    name: Shallow Pools
    short_description: Ankle-deep water hides unknown depths
    long_description: >
      The water here appears shallow, but the bottom is treacherous mud
      that can swallow the unwary. Rotting logs provide uncertain footing,
      and clouds of insects swarm over the surface. Phosphorescent algae
      coats everything in a sickly glow.

    name: Quicksand Bog
    short_description: Deceptively solid ground conceals deadly traps
    long_description: >
      What appears to be mossy ground is actually quicksand barely covered
      by a thin layer of vegetation. Bones protrude from some of the pools,
      evidence of past victims. Local creatures have learned to avoid
      these patches, but the unwary can find themselves sinking rapidly.

    name: Fungal Grove
    short_description: Giant mushrooms tower overhead
    long_description: >
      Massive fungi grow here, their caps towering ten feet or more above
      the murky water. They emit a constant soft glow and release spores
      that create hallucinogenic effects in those who breathe them. The
      Mire Druids harvest these fungi for their rituals.

    name: Corrupted Druid Circle
    short_description: A ring of standing stones, thick with corruption
    long_description: >
      Ancient standing stones rise from the murky water, but they've been
      corrupted by the swamp's dark influence. Strange symbols are carved
      into them, glowing with sickly green light. The Mire Druids gather
      here to perform rituals that would horrify their nature-loving kin.

    name: Sunken Ruins
    short_description: The remnants of a drowned civilization
    long_description: >
      Crumbling walls and toppled columns rise from the black water, the
      remains of a city that existed before the swamp claimed this land.
      Barnacles and moss coat everything, and fish swim through empty
      window frames. Something valuable might still be hidden in the depths.

    name: Spore Cloud
    short_description: A perpetual cloud of hallucinogenic spores
    long_description: >
      The air here is thick with drifting spores, making it nearly impossible
      to see more than a few feet. Strange visions swim at the edge of
      perception, and it becomes difficult to tell what's real. Many who
      enter never find their way out, lost in endless hallucinations.

    name: Temple Approach
    short_description: A causeway of ancient stone leads into the mist
    long_description: >
      A raised stone pathway, remarkably intact, leads south through the
      swamp. Carvings on the surface have been worn smooth by time and
      water, but hints of an ancient religious imagery remain. The fog
      thickens ahead, concealing what lies at the path's end.

    name: The Bloated One's Lair
    short_description: A massive hollow in the swamp bed
    long_description: >
      The swamp opens into a wide, shallow depression dominated by rotting
      vegetation and the remains of countless creatures. This is the lair
      of the Bloated One, an undead giant toad that has grown enormous
      feeding on the swamp's corruption. Bones and half-digested prey
      litter the murky water.

    name: Shrine of Decay
    short_description: A temple to rot and corruption
    long_description: >
      This ancient shrine has been converted to worship the Bloated One
      and the swamp's corruption. Offerings of flesh and bone are piled
      on an altar slick with algae, and the walls are decorated with
      morbid carvings of bloated creatures and spreading rot. The Mire
      Druids perform their darkest rituals here.
