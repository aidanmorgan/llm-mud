    short_description: A passage descends into volcanic darkness.
    long_description: >
      This passage leads from the Crucible's deepest forges into the
      volcanic depths below. The heat increases dramatically, and
      the stone walls give way to raw obsidian. An orange glow
      emanates from below.

    short_description: Walls of black volcanic glass surround you.
    long_description: >
      The tunnel is carved through solid obsidian, its walls reflecting
      the dim red glow from below. The air is searing hot, and the

      glitter dangerously.

    short_description: A ledge overlooks a river of molten rock.
    long_description: >
      This ledge offers a terrifying view of a lava river below.
      The heat is almost unbearable, and the light from the magma

      The fire cultists have established an outpost here, crude
      shelters of volcanic glass protecting them from the worst
