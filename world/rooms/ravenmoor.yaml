    short_description: The heart of Ravenmoor
    long_description: >
      You stand in the central square of Ravenmoor, a once-magnificent plaza now
      showing signs of neglect. Cracked cobblestones create uneven footing, and
      weeds push through the gaps. A tarnished bronze fountain stands in the
      center, its water stained and murky. Despite the decay, life persists here
      - merchants hawk their wares from rickety stalls, and citizens hurry about
      their business. Roads branch off in all directions, leading to various
      districts of the city.

    short_description: The road leading to the castle
    long_description: >
      Once-grand houses line this wide avenue leading toward the castle. Many
      now stand empty, their windows boarded and gardens overgrown. The
      cobblestones here are better maintained than elsewhere, though weeds still
      creep between them. Iron lamp posts, many missing their lamps, line the
      street at regular intervals.

    long_description: >
      Massive iron gates stand between two weathered stone towers. The gates
      hang slightly askew on their hinges, but guards still maintain their post
      here. The castle rises beyond - a brooding stone fortress that has seen
      better days. Moss grows on its walls, and several windows are dark and
      empty.

      This spacious courtyard lies within the castle walls. A dry fountain
      stands in the center, its basin filled with dead leaves. Training dummies
      line one wall, used by the dwindling castle guard. Stone archways lead to
      various wings of the castle, though some are blocked by rubble.

      Faded tapestries hang from the high walls, their colors bleached by time.
      A threadbare carpet runs the length of the hall to a raised dais where a
      simple wooden throne sits. The original throne was sold long ago to pay
      debts. Despite the decay, the room retains an air of dignity, and the
      current steward conducts what official business remains.

      Wooden practice dummies and archery targets show heavy use. Weapon racks
      hold a motley assortment of practice weapons - wooden swords, blunted
      spears, and padded staves. A grizzled trainer watches over the area,
      ready to instruct those who seek martial knowledge.

      Simple wooden pews face a plain stone altar at the front of this modest
      chapel. Candles flicker in niches along the walls, their light
      reflecting off a tarnished silver symbol of the old gods. The air
      smells of incense and old wood. A priest tends to the spiritual needs
      of those who still visit.

    short_description: The eastern marketplace
    long_description: >
      Merchants have set up stalls along this portion of the square, selling
      various goods. A weapons shop occupies a sturdy stone building, its
      shutters painted with crossed swords. Nearby, an armorer displays his
      wares on wooden mannequins outside his door. Business is slow, but
      the shopkeepers maintain hope for better days. A narrow alley leads
      behind the market stalls to the south.

      Weapons of all types hang from the walls of this shop - swords, axes,
      maces, and more. The quality varies, but everything is functional. The
      proprietor, a scarred veteran named Grimjaw, sits behind a counter
      sharpening a blade. He looks up as customers enter, his one good eye
      assessing their worth.

      from the walls, their surfaces displaying various heraldic designs.
      Leather armor, chainmail, and even a few pieces of plate are available
      for those who can afford them. The smith works at a small forge in the
      back, making repairs. A side door leads to a temple dedicated to healing.

      This side of the market caters to everyday needs. A general store
      occupies the corner, its windows crammed with miscellaneous goods.
      A tavern's faded sign creaks in the wind, promising food and drink.
      The smell of baking bread wafts from somewhere nearby. A tall tower
      rises to the west, its windows glowing with an eerie blue light.

      A fire burns low in a stone hearth, providing warmth against the damp.
      The barkeeper polishes glasses with a rag that has seen better days,
      while a few regulars nurse their drinks in shadowy corners.

      and the sounds of the tavern below are clearly audible. The rooms are
      sparse but clean enough - a bed, a small table, and a washbasin.
      It's not luxurious, but it's dry and relatively safe.

      The eastern gate of Ravenmoor stands partially open, its massive doors
      warped by age. Beyond lies the coastal road leading to the distant
      shores of Coral Bay. The gate guards here seem more relaxed than
      those at other entrances, perhaps because trouble rarely comes
      from the sea.

      rustic lodge is visible among the trees to the north, where rangers gather.
