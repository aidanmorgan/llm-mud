    name: Warriors' Barracks
    short_description: The training grounds of Ravenmoor's finest fighters
    long_description: >
      Heavy wooden training dummies line the walls of this expansive hall,
      many bearing deep gouges from countless practice sessions. The clang
      of practice swords echoes off stone walls, and the smell of leather
      and honest sweat fills the air. Battle standards hang from the rafters,
      each representing a victorious campaign from Ravenmoor's glory days.
      A grizzled veteran watches over the trainees with a critical eye.

  - id: ravenmoor_mage_tower
    vnum: 151
    name: The Arcane Sanctum
    short_description: A chamber of mystical learning and power
    long_description: >
      Towering bookshelves line the curved walls of this circular chamber,
      reaching upward into shadow. Floating orbs of soft light drift lazily
      between the shelves, illuminating ancient tomes bound in leather and
      stranger materials. Arcane circles are etched into the stone floor,
      faintly glowing with residual magic. The air hums with potential energy,
      making your skin tingle. At the chamber's center, a robed figure
      studies a massive grimoire.

  - id: ravenmoor_temple
    vnum: 152
    name: Temple of Light
    short_description: A sanctuary of divine healing and wisdom
    long_description: >
      Soft golden light filters through stained glass windows depicting
      scenes of mercy and healing. The temple's interior is simple but
      elegant, with polished wooden pews arranged before a marble altar.
      Candles burn in alcoves dedicated to various aspects of the divine.
      The air carries the faint scent of incense and healing herbs. Robed
      priests move quietly between the injured and sick who have come
      seeking aid.

    name: The Shadow Den
    short_description: A hidden den of rogues and cutpurses
    long_description: >
      Accessed through a nondescript door in a back alley, this dimly lit
      chamber serves as the headquarters for Ravenmoor's less reputable
      citizens. Shadows seem to move on their own, and you have the distinct
      feeling you're being watched from multiple directions. Various tools
      of the trade - lockpicks, cloaks, and daggers - hang on pegs along
      the walls. A hooded figure in the corner counts a pile of coins with
      practiced ease.

  - id: ravenmoor_rangers_lodge
    vnum: 154
    name: The Verdant Lodge
    short_description: A rustic lodge for wilderness trackers
    long_description: >
      This lodge sits at the edge of the city, half-built into the ancient
      trees that grow here. Hunting trophies and maps of distant wilds
      decorate the wooden walls. The scent of pine and earth mingles with
      that of curing leather. Bows of various sizes hang from racks, and
      quivers of arrows lean against the walls. A weathered tracker sits
      by the fire, sharpening a hunting knife.

    name: Back Alley
    short_description: A narrow alley behind the market
    long_description: >
      This narrow passage runs behind the market stalls, cluttered with
      refuse and broken crates. The buildings lean close overhead, blocking
      most of the light. Those who know where to look might find a certain
      unmarked door here, though most pass by without noticing.
