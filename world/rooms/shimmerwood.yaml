    short_description: The forest ahead shimmers with unnatural beauty.
    long_description: >
      The border of the Shimmerwood is unmistakable - ordinary trees give
      way to ones that seem to glow with inner light. Colors are more
      vivid here, sounds more musical. A path leads in, but whether it
      leads back out is another matter entirely.

    short_description: Perpetual dusk fills this peaceful glade.
    long_description: >
      The light here is that of eternal twilight, neither day nor night.
      Fireflies dance between flowers that should not bloom together.
      The grass is impossibly soft, and time seems to slow.

    short_description: A perfect circle of giant mushrooms.
    long_description: >
      Massive mushrooms form a perfect circle here, their caps large
      enough to sit upon. Fey creatures use these rings as meeting
      places and doorways to the Feywild. Standing in the center
      feels... significant.

    long_description: >
      Ethereal lights dance between the trees here, leading travelers
      deeper into the forest. Whether they guide or mislead depends
      entirely on their mood. Some are helpful; others lead to doom.

    short_description: A pool that reflects impossible things.
    long_description: >
      This pool shows not your reflection, but glimpses of other times
      and places. The water whispers secrets to those who listen, though
      understanding them is another matter. Fey sometimes come here to
      see their futures.

      This crossroads has more paths leading from it than should be
      geometrically possible. Some paths go up into the trees, others
      seem to lead underground, and at least one appears to go sideways
      through reality itself.

      This garden is a fragment of the Summer Court, warm and bright
      despite the forest's twilight. Flowers of impossible beauty bloom
      eternally, and the air is thick with intoxicating perfume. Summer
      fey dance here, beautiful and terrible.

      Ice and snow cover this grove despite the forest around it. The
