    short_description: Floating stones rise into the clouds
    long_description: >
      A series of stone platforms float impossibly in the air, forming
      a stairway that rises into the clouds above Stillwater Monastery.
      Each step hovers perfectly still despite the fierce winds, held
      by ancient magic. Below, the world stretches out in miniature.
      The Skyreach Spire waits above.

    name: Spire Entrance
    short_description: The base of the floating tower
    long_description: >
      The Skyreach Spire rises impossibly above, its base floating on
      nothing but magic. The entrance is a grand archway carved with
      runes of levitation and wind. Inside, you can see that gravity
      works strangely - furniture on the ceiling, water flowing upward.

    name: Gravity Hall
    short_description: Where up and down have no meaning
    long_description: >
      This hall exists in a state of fluctuating gravity. Portions of
      the floor become ceiling without warning, and you might find
      yourself walking on walls. The scholars who live here have
      adapted, but visitors often become violently disoriented.

    ambient_messages:
      - Gravity shifts suddenly, pulling in a new direction.
      - Objects float past, caught between competing gravities.

    name: Floating Library
    short_description: Books drift through the air
    long_description: >
      The library has no shelves - books simply float, organized by
      some system that only the scholars understand. Reading alcoves
      are scattered at all angles, some on the walls or ceiling. The
      collected knowledge of the Skybound Scholars fills the air with
      the rustle of turning pages.

    vnum: 1304
    name: Star Observatory
    short_description: Windows look out on endless sky
    long_description: >
      The walls here are mostly glass, providing a panoramic view of
      the sky in all directions - even below. At night, the stars seem
      close enough to touch, and strange instruments track celestial
      movements. The scholars study the heavens, seeking patterns in
      the cosmic dance.

    name: Scholars' Quarters
    short_description: Living spaces adapted to strange gravity
    long_description: >
      The Skybound Scholars have made comfortable homes here, with beds
      and furniture anchored at various angles. Some prefer ceiling-beds,
      others wall-mounted workspaces. The quarters are peaceful despite
      the disorientation, a place of study and contemplation.

    name: Elemental Laboratory
    short_description: Where wind and lightning are harnessed
    long_description: >
      This laboratory studies the elemental forces that keep the spire
      aloft. Contained whirlwinds spin in glass spheres, and lightning
      crackles between copper rods. The experiments here are dangerous
      but have yielded great knowledge about air magic.

    name: Wind Chamber
    short_description: Howling gales fill this open space
    long_description: >
      This chamber is open to the sky through great windows, and powerful
      winds constantly howl through. The winds are not natural - they're
      controlled, channeled, used to power the spire's magic. Air
      elementals dance in the currents, and stepping wrong could send
      you flying into the clouds.

    name: The Stormwright's Sanctum
    short_description: Where the master of winds holds court
    long_description: >
      The highest chamber of Skyreach Spire belongs to the Stormwright,
      an air elemental who long ago took human form to study magic with
      the scholars. Now ancient beyond measure, he commands the winds
      that keep the spire aloft. His power crackles in the air like
      approaching thunder.

      - Thunder rumbles with his displeasure.
