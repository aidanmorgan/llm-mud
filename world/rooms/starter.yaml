    name: Village Square
    short_description: The center of the village
    long_description: >
      You stand in the bustling center of a small village. A weathered stone
      fountain bubbles cheerfully in the middle of the square, surrounded by
      cobblestones worn smooth by countless footsteps. Colorful awnings shade
      the storefronts that line the square, and the smell of fresh bread
      drifts from a nearby bakery.

    name: North Road
    short_description: A dusty road leading north
    long_description: >
      The road here is lined with modest wooden houses, their thatched roofs
      showing signs of recent repairs. Vegetable gardens grow behind low
      fences, and chickens peck at the ground. The road continues north
      toward the forest.

    name: South Gate
    short_description: The village's southern entrance
    long_description: >
      Two sturdy wooden gates stand open here, flanked by a pair of guard
      towers. A bored-looking guard leans against one of the posts, idly
      watching travelers come and go. Beyond the gates, a well-worn path
      leads south toward distant hills.

    name: The Wanderer's Rest
    short_description: A cozy village inn
    long_description: >
      Warmth and the smell of hearty stew greet you as you enter the inn.
      A crackling fire burns in a large stone hearth, casting dancing shadows
      on the timber walls. Rough-hewn tables fill the common room, and a
      long bar runs along the far wall where the innkeeper polishes mugs.

    short_description: A well-stocked shop
    long_description: >
      Shelves line every wall of this cluttered shop, filled with an eclectic
      assortment of goods. Rope, lanterns, dried foods, and basic adventuring
      supplies compete for space. A cheerful merchant stands behind a worn
      wooden counter, ready to help customers.

    name: Forest Entrance
    short_description: Where the road meets the forest
    long_description: >
      The village road ends here at the edge of an ancient forest. Towering
      oak trees form a natural archway over a narrow path that winds into
      the shadowy depths. Strange bird calls echo from within, and the air
      grows noticeably cooler under the canopy.

    name: Forest Path
    short_description: A winding path through the trees
    long_description: >
      The forest closes in around you here, the path barely wide enough for
      two people to walk abreast. Gnarled roots snake across the ground,
      and thick ferns brush against your legs as you pass. The light is
      dim, filtered through countless leaves overhead.

    name: Sunlit Clearing
    short_description: A peaceful forest clearing
    long_description: >
      You emerge into a small clearing where sunlight streams down through
      a gap in the canopy. Wildflowers carpet the ground in a riot of color,
      and butterflies dance from bloom to bloom. A moss-covered boulder
      sits at the center, perfect for resting.

    name: Deep Forest
    short_description: Deep within the ancient woods
    long_description: >
      This part of the forest feels older, more primal. The trees here are
      massive, their trunks wider than houses, and strange phosphorescent
      mushrooms glow faintly in the perpetual twilight. The air is thick
      with the smell of moss and decay.

    short_description: The road south from the village
    long_description: >
      The road stretches south across rolling grasslands toward distant
      hills. Farmers' fields line either side, golden wheat swaying in
      the gentle breeze. A weathered signpost points back toward the village.

    short_description: A shimmering magical gateway
    long_description: >
      In the center of this small grove stands an ancient stone archway,
      covered in glowing runes. Within the arch, reality seems to shimmer
      and twist, revealing glimpses of strange lands beyond. The air
      crackles with arcane energy.
