      High stone walls surround the monastery, their ancient stones

      treacherous mountain path.

      A peaceful courtyard lies within the monastery walls. Carefully
      raked gravel surrounds islands of carefully pruned trees and
      bushes. Monks move silently along the covered walkways, their
      robes rustling softly. The air is thin but clean, and the
      silence is profound.

      Simple but elegant, the Abbot's quarters reflect a life dedicated
