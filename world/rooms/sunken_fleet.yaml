    short_description: The seafloor drops away toward a field of wrecks.
    long_description: >
      The sandy seafloor descends here toward a massive underwater
      graveyard. Hundreds of ships from an ancient naval battle
      lie scattered across the deep. Ghostly lights flicker among
      the wrecks, and shadows move between hulls.

    short_description: Scattered hulls of smaller ships lie here.
    long_description: >
      The outer edge of the fleet graveyard contains smaller vessels -
      scouts, merchants, and support ships. Many are broken beyond
      recognition, but some are intact enough to explore. Fish swim
      through broken portholes.

    short_description: Shattered masts rise from the seafloor like a forest.
    long_description: >
      Countless broken masts jut from the sand here, creating an
      underwater forest of rotted wood. Kelp has grown over them,
      and visibility is poor. Things hide among the columns, waiting
      for prey.

      The cargo holds of many ships spilled their contents here.
      Gold coins, jewelry, and precious goods cover the sand like

      died protecting it.

      This merchant ship went down with its cargo intact. The hold

      Crates and barrels fill this hold, their contents mostly

      The great warships from both fleets lie here, their final

      These two warships went down together, grappled in mortal

      The largest ship in the graveyard lies ahead - the admiral's

      signs of wealth and power. Maps cover the walls, and treasures
