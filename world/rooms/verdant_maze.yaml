    name: Entrance to the Verdant Maze
    short_description: A towering hedge maze stretches before you.
    long_description: >
      The entrance to the Verdant Maze is an archway of living vines
      and flowers. Beyond, hedge walls rise thirty feet high, forming
      an impossible labyrinth. A stone marker warns that paths shift
      without warning.

    short_description: Tall hedges block all but the sky.
    long_description: >
      The hedge walls rise impossibly high, blocking all view of the
      surrounding area. The path is well-maintained here, suggesting
      you're still in the outer sections. Flowers bloom in the hedge
      walls, their scents intoxicating.

    short_description: A hidden garden within the hedge.
    long_description: >
      This small alcove contains a riot of flowers in impossible
      colors. A stone bench offers rest, and butterflies the size
      of hands flutter between blooms. It feels like a sanctuary
      from the maze's confusion.

    short_description: Multiple paths branch from this intersection.
    long_description: >
      Several paths branch from this junction, each looking identical
      to the others. The hedges seem to watch you, leaves rustling
      without wind. Choosing the wrong path could lead to endless
      wandering.

    short_description: Ancient statues stand among the hedges.
    long_description: >
      Stone statues of forgotten figures stand in this clearing.
      Some are whole, others broken by time or violence. Moss and
      vines cover them, and flowers grow from cracks. They seem
      to watch visitors with stone eyes.

    short_description: An overgrown garden lost within the maze.
    long_description: >
      This was once a cultivated garden, but the maze has reclaimed
      it. Plants grow wild, vines strangle ancient trellises, and
      what might be benches are buried under greenery. The bones
      of past explorers are visible among the plants.

    name: Inner Maze - Eastern Path
    short_description: The hedges here seem more alive.
    long_description: >
      The inner maze is more dangerous. The hedges actively shift
      when you're not looking, and the plants themselves seem hostile.
      Thorny vines reach toward passersby, and the flowers smell of
      decay.

    long_description: >
      The hedge walls here have developed eyes - or what look like
      eyes. Flower faces turn to follow your movement, and the rustle
      of leaves sounds too much like whispers. The center must be
      near.

    long_description: >
      This section of hedge has become fully animate, a wall of
      grasping vines and snapping flowers. It must be fought through
      or appeased to pass. The maze itself seems to be testing you.

    short_description: The maze center is close now.
    long_description: >
      The path here is perfectly maintained, as if the maze wants
      you to reach its center. Flowers bloom in precise patterns,
      and the air smells sweet. The Maze Heart lies just ahead,
      waiting for those who would claim its secrets.

    long_description: >
      At the very center of the Verdant Maze lies its heart - not
      just a location but a living entity. A massive flower opens
      and closes like breathing, vines form a throne, and a face
      can almost be seen in the patterns of leaves. The Maze Heart
      is aware, ancient, and not pleased by intruders.
