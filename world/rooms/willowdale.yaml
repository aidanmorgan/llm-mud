    short_description: The heart of Willowdale
    long_description: >
      A pleasant village green lies at the center of Willowdale. Children
      play on the grass while elders sit on benches under ancient willow
      trees. A well stands in the center, its bucket worn smooth by
      countless hands. The peaceful sound of flowing water comes from
      the river nearby.

    name: Riverside Docks
    short_description: Wooden docks along the river
    long_description: >
      Simple wooden docks extend into the slow-moving river. Fishing boats
      bob gently on the water, and nets hang drying on wooden frames.
      Fishermen mend their equipment or prepare for their next expedition.
      The smell of fish and river water fills the air.

    name: Fisher's Cottage
    short_description: A cozy cottage by the river
    long_description: >
      This modest cottage belongs to the village's master fisher. Fishing
      rods, nets, and tackle hang from every available surface. A small
      hearth keeps the room warm, and the smell of smoked fish lingers
      in the air. A comfortable chair sits by the window overlooking
      the river.

    name: Willowdale Mill
    short_description: An old water mill
    long_description: >
      The village mill sits beside a small stream, its great wooden wheel
      turning slowly with the current. The sound of grinding grain fills
      the air, and sacks of flour are stacked near the door. The miller
      is a busy person, always working to keep up with the village's needs.

    name: Farmstead
    short_description: A well-tended farm
    long_description: >
      Rows of vegetables grow in neat lines, and a small orchard of fruit
      trees shades the farmhouse. Chickens scratch in the yard, and a
      cow grazes in a small pasture. The farmer waves a greeting as
      they work the soil.
