    short_description: The mountain path begins its steep ascent.
    long_description: >
      The path to Windreach Peaks begins here, switchbacking up the
      mountainside. Already the air is thinner and the wind stronger
      than in the lowlands. Distant peaks pierce the clouds above.

    name: Lower Mountain Path
    short_description: A treacherous path winds up the mountainside.
    long_description: >
      The path here is narrow and treacherous, barely wide enough for
      single file travel. To one side, the mountain rises; to the other,
      a sheer drop. The wind tugs at clothing and equipment.

    name: Cliff Ledge
    short_description: A wide ledge offers respite from the climb.
    long_description: >
      This natural ledge provides a place to rest before continuing
      the ascent. Prayer flags have been strung here by pilgrims, and
      small shrines to the wind gods dot the area.

    short_description: Massive nests cling to the cliffsides.
    long_description: >
      The griffin riders of Windreach raise their mounts here. Massive
      nests large enough for houses cling to the cliffs, and the
      majestic creatures come and go freely. Handlers tend to the
      younger animals.

    short_description: The path nears the cloud line.
    long_description: >
      Clouds drift past at eye level now, and the wind has become

      carved by ancient hands. Storm temples are visible above.

      This shrine honors the four wind gods - North, South, East, and
      West. Offerings of feathers, prayers written on silk, and wind
      chimes fill the space. The shrine seems to calm the wind around it.

    short_description: A stone bridge arches through the clouds.
    long_description: >
      This ancient bridge spans a gap in the peaks, passing through
      the clouds themselves. At times the bridge seems to vanish into
      mist, and wind spirits play in the currents around it.

      Massive stone gates carved with lightning patterns mark the

      The main hall of the Storm Temple is a display of controlled
      power. Lightning continuously arcs between tall metal pillars,
