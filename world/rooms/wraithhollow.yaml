    name: Road to Wraithhollow
    short_description: A road ends at a wall of unnatural darkness.
    long_description: >
      The road simply stops here, blocked by a wall of supernatural
      darkness that marks the boundary of Wraithhollow. Beyond, shapes
      can barely be seen - buildings, trees, things that might be people.
      The darkness emanates cold and dread.

    name: Village Gate
    short_description: A rotted gate hangs open.
    long_description: >
      The gate to Wraithhollow was once sturdy, but time and neglect
      have reduced it to splinters. The darkness is total here, and
      only magical light or special sight can penetrate it. Ghostly
      faces peer from nearby buildings.

    name: Main Street
    short_description: A ghostly main street frozen in time.
    long_description: >
      The main street of Wraithhollow looks like time stopped mid-moment.
      Shop signs hang frozen, doors stand half-open, and ghostly figures
      go about their business, unaware of their own death. The silence
      is broken only by phantom sounds.

    short_description: A shop where a ghost still tends the counter.
    long_description: >
      Dusty goods line the shelves of this abandoned store. A spectral
      shopkeeper stands behind the counter, going through the motions
      of a transaction with invisible customers. Some items here still
      retain value to the living.

    name: The Last Drink Tavern
    short_description: A tavern where the dead still drink.
    long_description: >
      Phantom patrons sit at tables, raising ghostly mugs to lips
      that feel nothing. A spectral bartender polishes glasses that
      will never be clean. The revelry is silent and terrible in its
      frozen joy.

    short_description: Guest rooms where travelers died in their sleep.
    long_description: >
      These rooms offered respite to travelers who never left. Beds
      still hold the impression of bodies, and some rooms contain the
      spirits of those who died here. The curse took everyone in a
      single night.

    name: Village Square
    short_description: The center of the cursed village.
    long_description: >
      This square was once the heart of village life. A well stands
      in the center, its water turned to black ichor. Ghostly
      children play games they will never finish, and vendors hawk
      wares to customers who cannot hear.

    long_description: >
      The blacksmith's forge still appears to burn, but the fire gives
      no heat. A spectral smith hammers at an anvil, creating weapons
      that dissolve when he stops. Some of the tools here still work.

    short_description: A graveyard where the dead do not rest.
    long_description: >
      Every grave here is occupied, but none of the dead rest within
      them. Tombstones bear dates that all match - the night of the
      curse. Some graves have been clawed open from the inside, and
      things still move beneath the soil.

      This church was where the villagers fled when the curse came.
      It did not save them. Phantom worshippers still kneel in the
      pews, praying to a god who did not answer. The altar is stained
      with ectoplasmic residue.

    short_description: A manor where tragedy still echoes.
    long_description: >
      This manor belonged to a bride who lost her husband on their
      wedding day - the day of the curse. Her grief was so powerful
      it may have caused the curse itself. She waits within, weeping
      eternally, her sorrow a weapon against the living.
