# Ashveil Wastes - Volcanic badlands zone
zone_id: ashveil
name: Ashveil Wastes
description: >
  A scorched expanse of volcanic badlands to the west of Ravenmoor. Once
  fertile farmland, a cataclysmic eruption centuries ago transformed it
  into a hellscape of ash, obsidian formations, and smoldering vents.
  The Ashborn nomads eke out an existence here, their skin scarred by
  constant exposure to heat and cinders.
