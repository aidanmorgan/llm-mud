name: The Bleached Wastes
description: >
  An ancient battlefield where two great armies annihilated each other in a
  cataclysmic conflict. The sun-bleached bones of thousands cover salt flats
  that stretch to the horizon. Nothing grows here, and the spirits of fallen
  soldiers still fight their eternal war each night.
