name: The Crucible
description: >
  An ancient dwarven forge-city built into the heart of a volcano. Massive
  forges powered by the mountain's eternal fires produce weapons and armor
  of legendary quality. Golem guards patrol the streets, and the rhythmic
  hammering never stops. The heat is oppressive to outsiders, but the dwarves
  and their creations thrive in it.
