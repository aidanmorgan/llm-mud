# Crystaldeep Caverns - Living crystal network zone
zone_id: crystaldeep
name: Crystaldeep Caverns
description: >
  A vast underground network of caverns where massive crystals grow like
  forests of frozen light. The crystals sing when struck, creating
  haunting harmonies that echo through the depths. Memory stones preserve
  echoes of the past, and the Crystal Singers mine the formations for
  their mystical properties. The Resonance, a sentient crystal entity,
  watches over all.
