# Drowned Sanctum - Underwater temple zone
zone_id: drowned_sanctum
name: Drowned Sanctum
description: >
  A vast temple complex that sank beneath the waves in ages past, now
  accessible via the Sunken Causeway from Coral Bay. Air pockets exist
  in sealed chambers, and bioluminescent life illuminates coral-encrusted
  halls. The Deep Ones worship ancient sea gods here, and drowned priests
  maintain rituals that keep the waters calm. The Abyssal Herald, a
  kraken-touched priest, guards the inner sanctum.
