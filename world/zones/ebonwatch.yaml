# Ebonwatch Citadel - Shadow fortress zone
zone_id: ebonwatch
name: Ebonwatch Citadel
description: >
  A fortress shrouded in eternal twilight where shadow magic pervades
  every stone. The Shadow Court holds power here, dark nobles who traded
  their souls for immortality in the gloom. Bound spirits whisper secrets
  in the walls, and reality itself seems thin - mirrors show other worlds,
  shadows move with purpose. The Umbral Warden guards the deepest vaults.
