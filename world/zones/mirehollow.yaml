# Mirehollow Swamp - Toxic wetlands zone
zone_id: mirehollow
name: Mirehollow Swamp
description: >
  A vast, treacherous swamp south of the Ashveil Wastes. Bioluminescent
  fungi cast an eerie glow across stagnant pools, while hallucinogenic
  spores drift on fetid breezes. Sunken ruins hint at a civilization
  drowned long ago. The Mire Druids have been corrupted by the swamp's
  influence, now serving darker purposes.
