# Obsidian Depths Zone
# Volcanic underworld, lava rivers, fire creatures

zone_id: obsidian_depths
name: The Obsidian Depths
description: >
  Deep beneath the Crucible lies a network of volcanic caverns where lava
  flows like rivers and the air itself burns. Obsidian formations create a
  landscape of razor-sharp beauty, and creatures of living fire dwell in
  the magma. Fire cultists worship here, seeking to awaken something ancient
  that sleeps in the deepest chambers.
