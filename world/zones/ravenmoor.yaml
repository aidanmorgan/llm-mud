name: Ravenmoor
description: >
  A once-grand city now fallen into disrepair. Ravenmoor serves as the starting
  point for new adventurers, offering basic services, training, and connections
  to the surrounding lands. The castle still stands, though its glory has faded,
  and merchants struggle to maintain their shops amid the decay.
