# Shimmerwood Zone
# Fey-touched forest, reality-bending, eternal twilight

zone_id: shimmerwood
name: The Shimmerwood
description: >
  A forest touched by the Feywild, where reality bends to the whims of its
  fey inhabitants. The trees seem to shift when you're not looking, paths
  lead to unexpected places, and time flows strangely. It is beautiful and
  dangerous in equal measure, trapped in eternal twilight.
