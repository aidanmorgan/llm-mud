# Skyreach Spire - Floating tower zone
zone_id: skyreach
name: Skyreach Spire
description: >
  An ancient mage tower floating impossibly above the clouds, accessible
  only via magical stepping stones from Stillwater Monastery. Gravity
  works strangely here - some rooms are inverted, others have no up or
  down at all. Elemental winds howl through broken windows, and the
  Skybound Scholars continue their esoteric research, tended by elemental
  servants. The Stormwright, an air elemental archmage, commands the spire.
