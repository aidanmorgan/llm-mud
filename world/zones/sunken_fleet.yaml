zone_id: sunken_fleet
name: The Sunken Fleet
description: >
  A naval graveyard where hundreds of ships from a great sea battle lie on
  the ocean floor. The wrecks are home to drowned sailors who don't know
  they're dead, treasure hunters who never left, and sea creatures that
  have made the hulks their lairs. Fortunes in gold lie scattered among
  the wreckage, guarded by the dead.
