# Thornhaven - Overgrown fortress zone
zone_id: thornhaven
name: Thornhaven
description: >
  An ancient fortress overrun by aggressive plant life. Once a proud
  stronghold guarding the River Road from Willowdale, it was abandoned
  after a druidic curse caused the surrounding vegetation to consume
  the stone walls. Now the Thornwatch, twisted guardians, patrol its
  living corridors. The Briar King, a knight corrupted by plant magic,
  rules from the central keep.
