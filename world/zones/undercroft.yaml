# The Undercroft - Deep dungeon zone
zone_id: undercroft
name: The Undercroft
description: >
  The deepest level of the Ironvein Mine complex - an ancient prison
  built to contain horrors from before recorded history. Sealed chambers
  hold creatures that should not exist, and cursed gold lies heaped in
  forgotten vaults. Ghostly wardens still patrol, their duty unending,
  while mad prisoners babble prophecies. The First Prisoner, a bound
  demon lord, strains at chains that have held for millennia.
