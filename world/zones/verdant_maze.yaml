name: The Verdant Maze
description: >
  A massive hedge labyrinth that covers miles of land, grown by ancient druids
  as a test for those seeking nature's secrets. The hedges are alive and
  constantly shift, making mapping impossible. Hidden gardens, trapped explorers,
  and the Maze Heart at its center await those who enter.
