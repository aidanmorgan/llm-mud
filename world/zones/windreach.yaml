name: Windreach Peaks
description: >
  The highest peaks in the realm, where the air is thin and the wind never
  stops. Ancient temples to the storm gods cling to impossible cliffs, and
  griffin riders patrol the skies. Only the most determined climbers reach
  the summit, where legends say the Storm God himself once walked.
