# Haunted village, eternal night, tragic ghosts

zone_id: wraithhollow
name: Wraithhollow
description: >
  Once a prosperous village, Wraithhollow fell to a terrible curse that killed
  every inhabitant in a single night. Now the villagers exist as ghosts, trapped
  in an endless loop of their final day. Eternal darkness shrouds the village,
  and the living are not welcome. Yet treasures and secrets lie buried here,
  waiting for those brave enough to face the dead.
